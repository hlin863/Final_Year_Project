# Final_Year_Project
 I'm creating a repository for my final year project on a machine learning continuous integration tool. Using Azure Machine Learning pipeline to help with training and preparing data for a machine learning model. After preparing the machine learning code, the Jenkins server will act as a continuous integration hub to link up and compile the code. This repository contains the experimental code for the functions.
